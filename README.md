This repository was created for the sole purpose of writing notes as I learn how to use this platform.
## Things I've learned so far
1. Repositories are used to 'package' things belonging to a single project. If for example, a project contains HTML, CSS, JS and some images, then all the files/folders containing these must be in the repo. I also learnt that that's what repositories are called in short,haha.
2. Branches allow one to have different versions of a repo. Say you've gotten some new ideas that you want to incorporate in your project but you're uncertain about whether or not to make the changes permanent, then you can create a branch off of main( when you create a new repo, it is the main branch by default) and make the changes there. Saved changes are called commits. Commits made on a branch will **only** appear on the main branch if the two have been merged. Each commit must be accompanied by a message that explains what the change is and why it was made. I think this will be my favourite feature.
